Subject: Follow-up on SAB Applications Monitoring

Hi Joe,

I hope you're doing well!

I'm reaching out following our discussion on Teams on February 19 regarding the monitoring of SAB applications.

As a reminder, here are our prerequisites:

A single access point for employees
The ability to parse logs to filter by type (ERROR, WARNING, etc.) and based on values and keywords
Support for multiline logs, such as Java stack traces
The possibility to add alerting later on
According to you, the most suitable solution would be something like "nani + nana."

Julien, who is copied on this email, will be supporting me during the Hackathon. With this in mind, we would like to prepare the necessary prerequisites outlined on this page:

Among them, I see some that relate to Azure DevOps. Could you confirm whether they are indeed required? Thanks in advance!

Prereq 1
Prereq 2
etc.
Best regards,
